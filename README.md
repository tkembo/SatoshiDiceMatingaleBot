# SatoshiDiceMatingaleBot

My code may be messy, but it works!

Let me also add another disclaimer: If you keep playing, you will eventually lose all your money on Satoshi Dice. But then again, you will probably have more luck than I did. In fact, sometimes I think that if I didn't have bad luck then I probably wouldn't have any luck at all.

This bot uses the [matingale strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29) to make bets on [satoshidice.com](https://satoshidice.com).

## How it works
- First deposit on Satoshi Dice. Take note of your secrete (in the URL)
- Modify the first few lines of index.php
- put index.php on a web server and access from a browser or from the terminal. It will do the number of bets you have specified in $numThrows

If you still think that my code is messy, you should submit a pull request.

If you happen to have more luck than I did, I would apreciate if you buy me a beer: [12Y2jQKC5ptGxfw2HbUYAPMDqBG5dW34NG](bitcoin://12Y2jQKC5ptGxfw2HbUYAPMDqBG5dW34NG)

Good luck!
